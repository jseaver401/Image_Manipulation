As with all of my programs for now this is to demonstrate my ability to do simple automation tasks with python.
This is a basic script to automate manipulating images by converting them from .tiff to .jpeg, rotating and resizing them
I used the pathlib rather than the os module because I think it is cleaner and the advice I got from StackOverflow is that it is a more "pythonic" way to do it. 
I used relative paths rather than absolute paths to make is cross platform compatible.
